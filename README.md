## Overview

At the core of our application lies the Spring Boot framework, providing a robust and scalable foundation for backend development. Hibernate is seamlessly integrated to manage the persistence layer, ensuring efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is employed for scalable and high-performance database management, facilitating seamless scalability and reliability.

On the frontend, React and Redux are utilized to create a dynamic and intuitive user interface, enhancing user experience and engagement. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is implemented to enable secure communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

Continuous Integration (CI) is achieved through Jenkins Pipeline, automating the build, test, and deployment processes. SonarQube and OWASP are integrated into the CI pipeline to enforce code quality and security standards, mitigating vulnerabilities and ensuring the reliability of the application. Containerization is facilitated using Docker, allowing for consistent deployment across different environments. Docker images are pushed to Docker Hub, enabling seamless distribution and deployment.
